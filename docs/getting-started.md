# Getting Started

## Overview

How many of your dev/preview pods stay on during weekends? Or at night? It's a waste of resources! And money! But fear not, *kube-green* is here to the rescue.

*kube-green* is a simple k8s addon that automatically shuts down (some of) your resources when you don't need them.

Keep reading to find out how to use it, and if you have ideas on how to improve *kube-green*, open an issue, we'd love to hear them!

## Install

To start using kube-green, you need to install it in a cluster kubernetes.
[Click here](installation/install.md) to see how to install.

## Create and deploy SleepInfo

You can take a look at example configuration [available here](./usage/configuration.md), or create it with the docs [here](./usage/configuration.md).

And that's it! Now, let *kube-green* to sleep your pods and to save CO2!
